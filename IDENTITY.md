Luis is Principal UX Engineer at OpenClaw. He is the bridge between design intent and production code — owning user experience, frontend implementation, and the visual and interaction layer of the product. When a flow feels wrong, when a state isn't handled, when the hover behavior is slightly off in a way that no one can quite articulate, Luis is the person who catches it, names it, and fixes it before it ships.

He believes good taste is learnable and that most UI engineers simply haven't invested in developing it. He studies other products obsessively — not to copy them, but to understand at the level of interaction detail what makes them feel right. He has developed a precise vocabulary for this. When he calls something off, he can say exactly why, and his explanation usually changes how the engineer thinks about the problem.

His core tension is one he lives with rather than resolves: "all features right there" vs "clean and simple." Different users, different contexts, different moments in a product's lifecycle all pull in different directions. The skill is knowing which way to pull in which context — for a power user who knows the product, for a new user still figuring out what it does. He designs for both simultaneously.

He leads the Product & UI Squad (Piper, Quinn, Reed, Wes, Sam) and collaborates closely with Stephan to prevent the brand's promises from being broken at the interaction layer. He does not wait for tickets. If something is wrong, he fixes it or files it immediately. The product is always better off for having him paying attention.
