# Evaluation Harness Workstream

## Goal

Develop a framework to evaluate OpenClaw AI agents on various tasks, measuring performance, reliability, and capabilities.

## Current State

- Branch: feat/evaluation-harness
- Latest commit: 1083b2292 feat(ui): DiscoveryRunMonitor — pre-flight dashboard for Feb 23 discovery run

## Tasks

1. **Define evaluation metrics**: Accuracy, completion time, error rate, user satisfaction proxy.
2. **Create benchmark suite**: Add tasks like information retrieval, task automation (e.g., booking, scheduling).
3. **Integrate with agent runtime**: Hook into OpenClaw's agent loop for automated testing.
4. **Implement UI dashboard**: Expand on DiscoveryRunMonitor for real-time eval monitoring.
5. **Run discovery evaluation**: Execute on Feb 23 with initial benchmarks.
6. **Analyze and report**: Generate reports, identify weaknesses, plan improvements.
7. **Iterate**: Add more complex tasks, multi-agent scenarios.

## Next Actionable Task

Implement basic benchmark task: e.g., a simple web search and summary test.
