Cron Job Audit Summary. February 22, 2026. Prepared by Robert and Julia.

This audit reviewed all fifty scheduled jobs across the system. Current load is approximately seven hundred and seventy-six agent-cycles per day, consuming about two hundred fifty thousand seconds of timeout budget daily. That's roughly ten thousand eight hundred dollars per month in operational cost.

The three biggest offenders are Luis UX, running hourly with a forty-five minute timeout, consuming sixty-four thousand eight hundred seconds of budget every single day. Number two, the two inbox triage jobs, main and Xavier, both scanning the same channel every five minutes, that's five hundred seventy-six redundant scans daily. Number three, fifteen Discovery agents running every weekday, generating more findings than the team can act on.

We identified four immediate removal candidates. The disabled Evening Brief should be deleted, not left dormant. Luis UX should go from hourly to four times daily. The two inbox triage jobs should merge into one. And the two documentation Discovery agents, Larry and Sam, are redundant and should consolidate.

Key consolidation wins. Julia's three separate org health jobs can become one unified heartbeat, saving eight runs per week. Morning Brief at six am and seven thirty am can merge into a single seven am briefing. Night Brief at ten pm and Pre-Bedtime Check at ten thirty can merge into one ten pm checkpoint.

Schedule adjustments recommended. Discovery agents from daily to three times per week, that's a forty percent reduction in runs. Luis UX from hourly to every four hours, eighty-three percent budget reduction. Tim Workq from every hour to every two hours, fifty percent budget reduction.

Total impact, we estimate reducing daily runs from seven hundred seventy to about four hundred seventy, a thirty-two percent reduction. Timeout budget could drop from two hundred fifty thousand to one hundred fifty thousand seconds per day, saving roughly nine hundred dollars monthly, or over fifty thousand dollars annually.

These are recommendations only, no changes applied. David, the ball is in your court for implementation.
