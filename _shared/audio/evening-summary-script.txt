Evening briefing. February twenty-first. Nine forty-two P.M. Mountain Time. This is Merlin.

Here's the full state of play and what's running overnight.

The day was productive. Luis completed the Horizon UI — all sixteen views built, clean build, P2 shell polish shipped including the command palette, keyboard shortcuts, toast system, skeleton loaders, and adaptive proficiency system. That PR, number forty-four, is open and mergeable — waiting on your final review before it lands.

Tim finalized the A2A Protocol consolidation — all five sub-PRs merged into the mega-branch, PR forty-three is ready for your review. He also wrote the Agent Handoff and Teamspace Specification — a solid architectural foundation for structured multi-agent coordination.

Xavier shipped the Telemetry Extension, PR forty-seven — seven files, three ninety-one lines, zero new root dependencies, TypeScript clean. Needs your sign-off alongside Tim's review.

Sandy completed the UTEE implementation, PR forty-six — twenty-eight tests passing, feature-flag off by default. Tim was notified but his session timed out earlier this evening. That's his first action tonight.

Now for overnight.

Luis is running three milestones with seven MiniMax M2.5 agents. Milestone one: Barry and Jerry are wiring all sixteen views to real Gateway APIs. The backend contract spec is written. Quinn is implementing the WebSocket connection state layer. Milestone two: Piper and Reed are completing the OnboardingFlow — WhatsApp QR polling, OAuth callbacks, provider connection states. Milestone three: Reed and Wes pick up i18n scaffolding and a full mobile responsive sweep across all sixteen views.

Tim is running three milestones with eight agents. Milestone one: reviewing and canary-approving PR forty-six, then Roman and Claire implementing the full UTEE middleware chain — retry, tracing, audit. Milestone two: Roman and Claire implementing ACL Phase 1, the A2M Agent-to-Agent Messaging protocol from Tim's spec — envelope types, routing layer, capability registry, task handoff primitive. Milestone three: PR triage, telemetry review, and integration test expansion with Larry, Harry, and Sandy.

Between both teams: fifteen agents, three milestones each, sixteen hours of continuous work.

One human action item for you before Sunday end of day: the Brave API Key. Web search is disabled for all agents, and the discovery system runs its first cycle Monday morning. It's a thirty-minute fix. Without it, every discovery agent runs blind.

Luis and Tim are each preparing short audio messages for you explaining their plans in their own words. Those should arrive shortly.

That's the evening brief. Good night, David.
