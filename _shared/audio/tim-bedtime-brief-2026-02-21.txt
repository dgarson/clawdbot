David, bedtime architecture brief from Tim.

First, what I’d start cooking overnight while you sleep.
I’d run three parallel workstreams, all safe, additive, and reviewable by morning.

Workstream one: UTEE canary operations prep to execution handoff.
Not new feature work, operational confidence work.
The objective is to wake up with a concrete go or no-go packet: canary toggles validated, rollback tested in a dry run, alert thresholds pre-wired, and a single-page canary decision checklist. We’ve done the implementation hardening. Overnight value is reducing uncertainty, not adding code for code’s sake.

Workstream two: ACL Phase One, A2M foundation stabilization.
We’ve got momentum, but this can go sideways if we let interfaces drift. So overnight I’d push for one stable envelope contract, one capability registry source of truth, and one ownership handoff primitive with strict invariants. The morning deliverable is not “more code,” it’s a coherent substrate that later teamspace and consensus features can actually compose on.

Workstream three: integration and failure-path harness.
I want a focused reliability harness that proves three things: one, subagent spawn and response loop integrity; two, cron delivery isolation and thread correctness; three, A2M and UTEE interaction safety under feature-flag permutations. This is where we buy down next-week risk fast.

Now the bigger question: your org management level. I think your instinct is right. You should not manage epics. You should manage quarterly deliverables.

I’d structure the next platform core layer as milestone contracts, each two to seven days, each with explicit acceptance criteria and business outcome.

Milestone one: Reliable Agent Execution Plane.
Scope: UTEE phase one canary complete, rollback confidence proven, observability minimum viable stack connected to tool execution.
Exit criteria: canary report signed, no regressions above threshold, and clear decision for broader rollout.

Milestone two: Agent Coordination Layer Phase One.
Scope: A2M envelope, routing baseline, capability registry, handoff primitive, and compatibility guarantees with existing sessions_send flows.
Exit criteria: conformance tests passing, integration harness green, and reference docs that let squads adopt without interpretation errors.

Milestone three: Delivery Integrity and Queue Governance.
Scope: cron routing correctness, no cross-thread contamination, stale work suppression, and clear ownership transitions in workq and board flows.
Exit criteria: measured reduction in delivery failures and fewer unowned tasks across a full day cycle.

Milestone four: Senior Review Gate Normalization.
Scope: codex-first sweep required, megabranch-only final review by senior lane, and standardized final review checklist for architecture correctness and security.
Exit criteria: one full cycle completed with documented before/after review throughput and defect catch rate.

That milestone framing lets you operate at the right altitude: pick outcomes, enforce exit criteria, and hold leads accountable for the epic decomposition below.

On process and tooling, here’s what makes this model real.
First, workq and WORKBOARD should map every epic to exactly one parent milestone id. No orphan epics.
Second, every status update should be milestone-centric by default: percent complete, risks, and decision needed.
Third, the heartbeat layer should only escalate milestone risk, not task chatter.
Fourth, require codex sweep artifact links before senior review starts. That removes a lot of review waste.

Net: you own milestone contracts and risk posture. We own decomposition and execution.
If we do that cleanly, you’ll get fewer updates, but higher signal, and the org will move faster with less thrash.

Sleep well. We’ll keep shipping.
