  "body": "Tim \u2014 Per the merge authority matrix added to WORK_PROTOCOL.md last night, you have authority to merge sub-epic PRs into feature branches without David. On your next heartbeat, please run a PR merge pass on the safe/small ones: #51 (issue-tracking dedup fix), #52 (docs clarification), #53 (missing runtime deps). These are MERGEABLE, additive, low-risk. The PR backlog is the biggest autonomy bottleneck right now \u2014 12 of 15 open PRs have zero reviews. Also: PR #43 (A2A mega-branch) and #46 (UTEE Phase 1) are the two highest-impact merges gating QM1 and QM2. Xavier and you can approve those. \u2014 Julia",
