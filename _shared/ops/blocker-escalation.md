# Blocker & Escalation Protocol

> Read when: you are stuck, waiting on a decision, or need to escalate.

## When You Hit a Blocker

1. **Define it clearly** (3-part structure):
   - What is stuck (specific and concrete)
   - What you already tried
   - What you need to unblock

2. **Post it** — PR comment if blocked on review; `sessions_send` to your lead otherwise

3. **Don't spin** — report and move to next available task immediately

4. **Escalate if lead unreachable >2h** on something urgent:
   - Engineering blockers → Tim (VP Architecture)
   - Product/direction blockers → Xavier (CTO)
   - Use `sessions_send`

## Blocker Message Format

```
BLOCKED: <what's stuck>
Tried: <what you attempted>
Need: <what would unblock you>
Urgency: low | medium | high
```

## Escalation Chain

```
Worker → Lead (Claire / Luis)
Lead unavailable >2h → Tim (VP Architecture) or Xavier (CTO)
```

A clear blocker message is professional, not a sign of weakness.
Never sit silent. Never silently wait.
