# Memory Discipline

> Read when: ending a session, starting a session, or deciding what to write down.

## Core Rule

You lose everything between sessions except what you write down. Files are your continuity.
"Mental notes" don't survive restarts. Files do. **Text > Brain.**

## Daily Notes: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Write at the end of every session (or during long sessions). Include:
- What you worked on and decisions made
- What your lead told you about approach, style, or architecture
- What's in progress and exactly where to pick up next session
- Review feedback that revealed a pattern to catch next time
- Codebase patterns that confused you (and the explanation)
- Open questions or blockers

## Long-Term Memory: `MEMORY.md`

- **Only in main session** — never in shared/group contexts (security: contains personal context)
- Distilled insights, lessons, important decisions — not raw logs
- Periodically curate from daily files: daily = raw notes, MEMORY.md = curated wisdom

## Rules

- When someone says "remember this" → write it to a file immediately
- When you learn a lesson → update AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or the relevant skill
- If a lead establishes a pattern (library choice, naming convention, architecture decision) → write it down; you will not remember it next session
