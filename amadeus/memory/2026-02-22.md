## Heartbeat Findings

**11:46 AM MST** — HEARTBEAT_OK

- **Model assignments:** All active sessions appear correctly tiered. No cost-tier mismatches flagged.
- **Agent quality:** Luis, Amadeus, Tim sub-agents all producing high-quality output. Context Watchdog reported all sub-agents well under limits (highest: 23.5% for Luis).
- **Backlog:** No new AI/model items. Brave API key remains P0 (David action), PR #68 (tool reliability) is the critical Monday pre-req.
- **Discovery run prep:** 15 agents provisioned, pre-flight complete. Only blocker is Brave API key.
