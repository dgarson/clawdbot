# GitHub URL Hyperlinking (Mandatory)

> **When to read:** You're mentioning branches, PRs, or issues to David in any message.

**Rule:** Every mention of a branch, PR, or GitHub Issue MUST be a clickable hyperlink. David should NEVER have to search GitHub manually.

## Formats

**Branches:**
- Slack: `<https://github.com/dgarson/clawdbrain/tree/BRANCH|BRANCH>`
- Markdown: `[BRANCH](https://github.com/dgarson/clawdbrain/tree/BRANCH)`

**PRs:**
- Slack: `<https://github.com/dgarson/clawdbrain/pull/N|PR #N>`
- Markdown: `[PR #N](https://github.com/dgarson/clawdbrain/pull/N)`

**Issues:**
- Slack: `<https://github.com/dgarson/clawdbrain/issues/N|Issue #N>`

## Rules

- NEVER mention a branch/PR/issue as plain text in work contexts
- ALWAYS include the GitHub URL inline so David can click directly
- Applies to: PR alerts, work summaries, branch mentions, everything
