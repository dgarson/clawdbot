## Key Deliverables

### TELEMETRY_SPEC.md

**File:** `drew/TELEMETRY_SPEC.md`
**What it is:** Agent Telemetry & Cost Attribution MVP Spec — authored by Merlin on Drew's behalf as CDO owner.
**Purpose:** Defines the observability foundation for OpenClaw's agent fleet. Addresses zero visibility into which agents consume the most tokens/cost, success/failure rates per agent/task, latency distributions, and anomalous behavior. Scopes the MVP to event capture, cost attribution, success/failure tracking, and dashboard-ready data with minimal latency overhead.
**Status:** DRAFT — awaiting review. Xavier built Phase 1 implementation (PR #47). TEL-01 task in WORKBOARD.md.
**Owner:** Drew (CDO) — engineering execution via Xavier/Tim.

### WORKFLOW_STARTER_PACKS.md

**File:** `drew/WORKFLOW_STARTER_PACKS.md`
**What it is:** Workflow Starter Packs v1 spec — defines installable, opinionated workflow templates to reduce new-user time-to-value.
**Purpose:** Makes OpenClaw's power discoverable by new users. Starter Packs are bundles: manifest file, agent configs, cron jobs, brief description, and example prompts. Goal: reduce TTV from hours to minutes.
**Status:** DRAFT — spec only. No implementation started.

## Pending

- TEL-01 (header injection for session attribution) is P0 — 73% of sessions missing cost data
- Coordinate with Robert (CFO) on telemetry data requirements for financial analytics
- Starter Packs spec needs David review before any implementation begins
