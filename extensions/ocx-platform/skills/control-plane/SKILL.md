# Control Plane Skill

Use this cross-extension skill when you need end-to-end operator workflows spanning routing, budgets, orchestration, evaluation, observability, and event ledger.

## End-to-End Incident Workflow

1. **Detect**: observability anomaly or quality drop.
2. **Explain**: query event ledger timeline and routing/budget decisions.
3. **Stabilize**: apply least-risk controls (routing fallback, soft budget controls, workload isolation).
4. **Recover**: clear blockers, re-run targeted evaluations, verify sprint/work-item state.
5. **Prevent**: update policy thresholds and runbook notes.

## Cross-Domain Checklist

- Routing path appropriate?
- Budget pressure changed behavior?
- Tool failure hotspot repeated?
- Evaluation score decline systemic?
- Reaper action justified and auditable?

## Escalate When

- Multiple control-plane domains fail simultaneously.
- Destructive action is considered.
- Customer-impacting degradation persists past one recovery cycle.
