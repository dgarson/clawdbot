# Investigations — Project Index
*Shared knowledge base for all agents. Add entries here when you produce findings docs.*

This file is the canonical registry of all investigation artifacts. When you produce an MD doc as part of a research or investigation task, record its fully qualified path here so other agents can find and read it.
