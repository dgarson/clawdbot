# Daily Memory — 2026-02-21 (Saturday)

## Context

- Principal TPM at OpenClaw
- Day 1 of active standup cadence
- Most of org came online Feb 20 (day one for many agents)

## Morning Session — Infrastructure Gaps (8:00 AM MST)

- GitHub CLI not authenticated — blocks issue/PR visibility
- No ROADMAP.md existed — created today
- Workq extension built (tests pass) but needed build script
- OAuth integration was spec-only, implementation pending
- 4+ engineers idle awaiting task assignment (Sandy, Tony, Harry, Larry)
- Tim was bottleneck: auth sign-off, ADRs, task prioritization

## Evening Session — Standup #2 (10:11 PM MST)

### Infrastructure Resolved

- GitHub CLI authenticated (dgarson/keyring) ✅
- Workq extension loading via jiti ✅
- Cron delivery threading fix MERGED (PR #36) ✅
- Tool reliability layer committed for non-Anthropic models ✅

### Major Deliverables Today

- 4 PRs merged: #36, #34, #33, #29
- A2A Protocol: all 5 sub-PRs merged into mega-branch (PR #43)
- UI Redesign: 17 views built by Luis — PR #44 ready for David
- Telemetry Extension Phase 1 built by Xavier — PR #47
- UTEE Phase 1 fixes complete (Sandy) — PR #46, Tim notified
- Integration test scaffold (Tim) — PR #48 (⚠️ targets main — flag)
- Discovery pre-flight: 🟢 GO for Monday Feb 23
- Quality Score baseline: 402 sessions scored, mean Q=0.818

### Open PRs Needing Action

- PR #43: David final review (A2A mega-branch)
- PR #44: David final review (UI mega-branch)
- PR #46: Tim review (UTEE Phase 1)
- PR #47: Review needed (Telemetry)
- PR #48: David confirm intent (targets main!)
- PR #45, #42, #35, #31: triage queue

### Blocking David Items (Pre-Monday Deadline)

- Brave API key — CRITICAL Monday blocker. All web search disabled for 15 discovery agents.
- `openclaw doctor --fix` — dm.policy migration active regression
- PR #48 intent confirmation

### Key Insights

- Ops ROI inversion confirmed: Opus scoring LOWER than Sonnet at 4x cost
- 73% of sessions lack cost attribution — TEL-01 (header injection) is P0
- Cost alert threshold defined: Q < 0.40 AND cost > $0.10 (per Robert)
- Discovery system architecture solid — 17 crons, 15 discovery agents, 2 reviewers

## Coordination Done

- ROADMAP.md created and updated twice (morning + evening)
- Tim notified re: PR #46 review
- Xavier notified re: PR #44 (UI mega-branch review)
- Xavier + Tim queued for morning: PRs #43, #44, #46, #47

## Next Actions (Monday)

1. Monitor discovery system first run (Mon Feb 23, 10 AM wave)
2. Confirm Brave API key configured (flag David Sunday)
3. Track PR review progress: #43, #44, #46, #47
4. Confirm PR #48 intent (targets main)
5. Push for OAuth OnboardingFlow decision
6. Enable heartbeats for Tim, Xavier, Amadeus (deferred from Cycle #8)
7. Begin triage of PR backlog: #45, #42, #35, #31, #28, #25
