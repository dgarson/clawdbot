# Daily Memory — 2026-02-22 (Sunday)

## Context

- Principal TPM at OpenClaw
- Standup cadence: Day 2
- Day 3 since org came online (Feb 20)
- QM pipeline v1 launched at midnight Feb 22

## Midnight Standup (12:00 AM MST) — Standup #4

### New Issues Since Last Standup (opened Feb 22, not yet in last memory)

**Critical Chain Discovered — Requires Immediate Response:**

- **#23263**: copilot-proxy config validation missing → infinite crash loop on upgrade
- **#23264**: Gateway crash loop triggers cleanup routine that OVERWRITES Keychain secrets with "[STORED_IN_KEYCHAIN]" placeholder string → permanent credential loss
- **#23302**: Cron runaway — `deleteAfterRun:true` job fires 500+ times (all logged as "skipped" but messages sent) — API budget burn risk

**Credential Destruction Chain:** #23263 (crash) → triggers → #23264 (Keychain overwrite) → user locked out. This is a DEPLOY-BLOCKER cluster affecting anyone on v2026.2.19-2.

**Other new issues:**

- #23258: Telegram delivery routing wrong session (wrong channel delivery)
- #23266: Telegram voice messages 30-60s delay before agent processes
- #23269: EADDRINUSE on Telegram webhook port 8787 during restart
- #23273: Webchat exposes internal metadata (Conversation info) to users
- #23278/#23283: Discord voice channel broken (autoJoin fails, /vc join not working)
- #23265: Feature — pre-tool-call interceptor hook
- #23270: Feature — native RSI hooks
- #23267: iOS/Android TestFlight access request

### PR Dashboard (Updated)

14 open PRs total — same as last night plus no new overnight additions beyond #51-54.

Key awaiting action:

- #54, #46, #47: Tim/Xavier can merge per Merge Matrix
- #43, #44: Xavier/Tim authority to merge to dgarson/fork (no David needed)
- #48: Still targeting main — unconfirmed intent
- #53, #51: Sandy quick-merge items

### Discovery System — Monday Status

- T-10 hours to Monday wave
- Brave API key: STILL MISSING → CRITICAL BLOCKER
- Tool reliability layer committed ✅
- Pre-flight GO ✅
- Risk: all web search disabled if Brave key not configured by morning

### QM Progress

- QM1 (Reliability): URGENT — Keychain overwrite (#23264) + cron runaway (#23302) are new P0 items
- QM2 (Coordination): A2A #43 still awaiting Xavier/Tim action (they have authority)
- QM3 (Delivery): TEL-01 still pending
- QM4 (Review Gate): PR backlog at 14 — leads need to act on their authority

### Autonomy Evolution

- Grade: C+ (Julia audit)
- 4 of 5 David escalations belonged to leads
- Leads have authority to merge #43/#44/#47 — they need to use it today

### David Action Items (Priority Order)

1. **Configure Brave API key** — Sunday EOD deadline, discovery at 10 AM Monday
2. **#23264 severity / release decision** — Keychain overwrite is a credential-destroying bug in production
3. **#23302 investigation priority** — cron runaway 500x could be a budget bomb if hitting discovery agents
4. **#23263 crash chain** — Should this trigger a hotfix release?
5. **PR #48 intent** — Does this target main or was that an error?
6. **OAuth OnboardingFlow** — Go/no-go before Luis proceeds

### Outgoing Coordination

- Xavier: Brief on #23264 + #23302 as new P0s (above prior 3 P0s)
- Tim: PR #46/#54 review — unblock QM1/QM2
- Xavier + Tim: Reminder they have authority to merge #43/#44/#47 NOW

## Next Actions (Monday Morning)

1. Monitor discovery system first run (10 AM wave)
2. Confirm Brave API key (flag David if not done)
3. Escalate #23264/#23302 to Xavier for immediate QM1 sprint loading
4. Chase #43/#44 merge — leads have authority
5. PR #48 final resolution
6. PR triage: #45, #42, #35, #31, #25
