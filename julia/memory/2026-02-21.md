# 2026-02-21 (Saturday) — Julia's Daily Log

## Major Events

### Session 1 (~9:04 AM – 3:48 PM) — Quiet Saturday Heartbeats
- Org was idle through morning/afternoon (expected Saturday)
- Checked session lists, cron health periodically
- Only my own heartbeat session running

### Session 2 (~8:57 PM) — First Active Org Health Scan
- Cycle8 nearly complete (6/7 sub-agents done, Tim's integration test scaffold last)
- Discovery pre-flight: 🟢 GO for Monday launch
- **Found 2 cron errors at 8AM:** Joey Product Standup + Amadeus C-Suite Morning Sync (both errored simultaneously)
- Generated TTS audio report for David in #cb-inbox (voice: nova)
- Wrote findings to `julia/findings/org-health-2026-02-21.md`

### Session 3 (~9:49 PM) — Overnight Engine Running
- Luis received 3-milestone overnight scope (7 agents), sub-agents already completing tasks
- Tim spawned Roman (UTEE) + Claire (ACL), sent audio update to David
- Merlin orchestrated full evening handoff

### Session 4 (~10:44 PM) — 401 Anthropic Key Issue
- Two claude-opus-4-6 sessions hit 401 invalid API key errors (~10:30 PM)
- Affected: workq Progress Check cron + #cb-inbox session
- Merlin already flagged to David in Pre-Bedtime Check
- Overnight work (Codex/GLM/MiniMax) unaffected — different providers

### Session 5 (~10:46 PM) — David's GLM-5 Assessment
- David diagnosed Claire's GLM-5 failure as hard capability boundary (output decoherence on complex TypeScript test suites >30k tokens)
- Directive: swap to codex-spark for a2m tests, never retry on GLM-5
- Sent Tim the model swap instruction (queued for pickup)
- GLM-5 operating envelope documented: no complex code generation tasks

### Session 6 (~11:42 PM) — AUTONOMY EVOLUTION INITIATIVE LAUNCHED 🚀
- **David's highest priority for next 2 weeks**
- Read framework: `_shared/AUTONOMY_EVOLUTION.md`
- Ran first full 6-dimension autonomy audit
- **Key findings:**
  - **Autonomy Grade: C+** (functional but David-dependent)
  - 4 of 5 escalations to David were decisions leads should have made
  - 4 of 6 P1 BACKLOG items blocked on David specifically
  - 6 PRs bottlenecked with no reviewer assigned
  - No merge authority matrix existed → nobody knew they could merge
  - No QM → Epic → Sprint pipeline exists
  - Joey (QM co-lead) has been dark all day
- **Concrete improvement made:** Added merge authority matrix (Section 12) and auto-claim protocol (Section 13) to `_shared/WORK_PROTOCOL.md`
- Sent Joey QM pipeline kickoff via agent-mail
- Wrote full audit: `julia/findings/autonomy-audit-2026-02-21-2340.md`

## Key Decisions/Directives
- David wants to manage only Quarterly Milestones (2-7 days each)
- Everything below QMs handled by org autonomously
- Julia = Autonomy Evolution lead for 2 weeks
- Joey = QM pipeline co-lead
- Merge authority: Tim/Xavier CAN merge mega-branches into dgarson/fork
- GLM-5: no complex code generation (hard boundary)

## Pending
- 8 AM morning report due tomorrow (cron will fire)
- Joey QM pipeline deliverables due by morning
- Track: David-escalations per 6h period, target <2 by end of week 1
- Claire a2m retry on codex-spark (sent to Tim)
- Brave API key still missing (Monday blocker)
