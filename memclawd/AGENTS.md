# MemClawd Agent Notes

- This directory contains the standalone MemClawd service.
- Use TypeScript (ESM) with strict typing and avoid `any`.
- Keep route handlers stubbed unless implementing full behavior.
- Prefer structured logging via pino and Hono middleware.
- Follow the repository TypeBox patterns for schema validation.
