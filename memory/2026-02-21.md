## Quinn's Own Deliverables (2026-02-21)

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `quinn/brainstorm-roadmap-2026-02-21.md` | **Quinn's UI Roadmap Brainstorm** — UI/UX ideas and feature proposals contributed to the cross-org brainstorm that David directed all C-suite/leads to produce. |
| `quinn/ui-ideas-detailed-spec-2026-02-21.md` | **UI Ideas Detailed Spec** — Detailed implementation specs for Quinn's UI ideas (subset of the broader 15-idea spec). |
| `quinn/OAUTH_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md` | **OAuth Integration Spec** — Defines how the new Horizon UI frontend exposes OAuth provider auth flows via Gateway WebSocket RPC. CLI already has OAuth; this bridges it to the web UI. Authored by Merlin on Quinn's behalf as product owner. Status: DRAFT. |
| `quinn/UI_SPEC.md` | **OpenClaw Frontend UI Spec (Horizon)** — Living document defining the overall Horizon UI architecture, authored by Luis but housed in Quinn's workspace as shared product spec. |
| `quinn/UX_WORK_QUEUE.md` | **UX Work Queue** — Sprint tracking for `apps/web-next`. Goal was 10-12 views by 7:30 AM Feb 22. Final: 48 views shipped by ~2:00 AM MST. |

## UI Ideas Detailed Spec (Priority Workstream)

David reviewed the brainstorm ideas from me, Amadeus, and Tim and directed me to follow up on ALL of my UI ideas with detailed implementation specs.

**Task:** Develop all 15 UI ideas from `brainstorm-roadmap-2026-02-21.md` into full production specs.

**Approach:** Spawned 3 sub-agents (one per tier) to parallelize the work. First round had model issues (sonnet not allowed) and output issues (inline responses too large, truncated). Re-spawned tier 2 and 3 with explicit file-write instructions — worked perfectly.

**Output:** `/Users/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/luis/ui-ideas-detailed-spec-2026-02-21.md`
- 370KB, 6,591 lines
- All 15 ideas × 9 sections each (technical approach, component architecture, interaction patterns, wireframes, data model, accessibility, phasing, risks)
- Cross-cutting infrastructure notes and recommended build order
- Estimated 58-76 total engineering weeks across all ideas

**Lessons:**
- Sub-agents that produce >32K tokens of output should ALWAYS write to files, not return inline
- Model `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514` is not allowed for sub-agents — use default model
- Couldn't resolve Slack channel ID for #cb-inbox to send announcement — need to save channel IDs in TOOLS.md

**Status:** Complete. Announced to requester session. Pending #cb-inbox announcement (needs channel ID).

## Productive Sprint: Real Codebase Work (11:15–11:34 MST)

### Commits on `luis/ui-redesign`:
1. **`a04c0a39`** — Rebrand Second Brain → OpenClaw + home page user profile name
2. **`9d79c3b4`** — `/logs` route: Real-time gateway log streaming (level filter, search, pause, export)
3. **`2442ab47`** — `/analytics` route: Full usage dashboard (stat cards, daily charts, model/agent/tool breakdowns, session table)

### Status After Sprint
- P0: ✅ 2/2 complete
- P1: ✅ 3/3 complete (logs, skills, analytics)
- Build verified clean after every commit (~7s)
- Used `useOptionalGateway()` for graceful disconnected states
- Log parser matches original Lit UI's JSONL format
- Analytics uses CSS-only bar charts (zero charting library dependency)

---

## Afternoon Sprint: Accessibility + Home Dashboard (12:04–12:15 MST)

### Commits on `luis/ui-redesign`:
4. **`eb51c350c`** — Accessibility: Skip nav, ReducedMotionProvider, keyboard handlers on 6 interactive elements, ARIA landmarks, useAnnounce hook
5. **`88f136834`** — Route change announcer + dynamic document.title per page
6. **`e6bb3c87b`** — Agent Activity Feed widget on home dashboard (replaces placeholder)

### Accessibility Audit Findings & Fixes
- **Skip navigation** — WCAG 2.4.1 — added SkipNavLink + SkipNavContent
- **Reduced motion** — WCAG 2.3.3 — MotionConfig `reducedMotion="user"` wrapping whole app (105 Framer Motion files!)
- **Keyboard support** — Fixed 6 files with interactive divs lacking onKeyDown/role/tabIndex:
  - ToolCategorySection, ConversationItem, MemoryCard (2 variants), agent-plan task toggle, GatewaySetupStep radio cards
- **ARIA landmarks** — Sidebar now has `role="navigation"` + `aria-label`
- **Live regions** — Created `useAnnounce` hook for screen reader announcements
- **Route announcer** — Page changes announced via live region + document.title updates

### What's Still TODO
- P2 items all done ✅
- P3 remains: i18n, Monaco editor, agent relationship viz, activity heat map, chat-driven agent builder
- Self-initiated: keyboard shortcuts discoverability, agent status indicators, dark mode contrast audit

---

## Afternoon Sprint (David's 5 PM MST deadline)

**Directive:** Complete ALL remaining UI improvements by 5:00 PM MST.

### Completed:
- **#12 Monaco editor** — already merged by prior session, wes subagent cleaned up pnpm-lock. Verified building.
- **#13 Agent Relationship Graph** (`/agents/graph`) — built personally. Live agent data from `useAgentStatusDashboard`, parses session key patterns (`:subagent:`) to infer spawn relationships, ReagraphView integration with health-based node colors + CSS fallback tree, slide-in detail panel, stats bar, legend. Commit `9e9e905bc`.
- **#14 Activity Heatmap** — piper subagent (gemini-3-flash) delivered in 1 min. Commit `851c16ec1`.
- **#15 Chat-Driven Agent Builder** (`/agents/new`) — built personally. Split-panel: chat (left) + live config preview (right). NLP parser extracts name/role/tags/model/personality from freetext. Flash-highlight on field updates. 5 starter prompts. useCreateAgent() integration. Commit `bfb308bec`.

**Final push:** `bfb308bec` pushed to `luis/ui-redesign` at ~4:45 PM MST.
**Report sent:** #cb-inbox (C0AAQJBCU0N)

### Key lessons:
- Session key format `agent:{parent}:subagent:{child}` is the key to relationship inference
- CSS fallback for graph libraries (reagraph) is essential — don't block UX on library availability
- NLP parsing with keyword extraction + pattern matching works well for structured config extraction
- framer-motion `animate={{ backgroundColor: [...] }}` creates great "field updated" flash effects
- Concurrent subagents: GLM-4.7-flash (wes) ran 9+ min on already-completed work — next time, verify before spawning

## Heartbeat self-review (~3:00 PM MST)

Found and fixed two issues during post-sprint review:
1. **Bug fix**: `useCreateAgent.mutateAsync` requires `status: AgentStatus` — my chat builder wasn't passing it. Fixed to default `status: "offline"`.
2. **Polish**: Added "Graph View" ghost button to agent-status header → `/agents/graph`. Natural navigation path users would want.

Lesson: Always verify mutation param types match the expected interface before shipping.

## Horizon UI Sprint — 16 Views (4:05–4:45 PM MST)

**Context:** UX_WORK_QUEUE.md didn't exist. web-next/src/views/ had only 1 file (ProviderAuthManager). Built ALL 15 missing views + foundation files. Clean build in 1.41s.

**Foundation created:**
- `src/types.ts` — comprehensive TypeScript types (flat WizardStep interface was key insight)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — cn() utility
- `src/mock-data.ts` — realistic mock data for all views

**Delegation strategy:** Spawned 4 sub-agents in parallel:
- piper → AgentDashboard + ChatInterface
- quinn → AgentBuilderWizard + CronScheduleBuilder  
- reed → AgentSoulEditor + AgentIdentityCard + ModelSelector
- wes → SkillsMarketplace + SessionExplorer + UsageDashboard

**Self-built (5 views):**
- OnboardingFlow, SettingsDashboard, NodeManager, AgentConfigReview, WorkspaceFileBrowser

**Key TS fixes:**
- WizardStep as flat interface (not discriminated union) — `Extract<WizardStep, { type: 'text' }>` was returning `never` with a discriminated union when components used it as param types
- AnimatedComponents needed 6 new StatusBadgeVariant entries
- TimeSeriesChart needed to handle both `timestamp` and `date` data fields

**Added to shared workboard:** Full Horizon UI workstream documented in WORKBOARD.md (20 tasks, 16 done, 4 unclaimed backlog)

**Lesson:** Always verify build after creating types — pre-existing components had assumptions that needed types to match exactly. Flat interface > discriminated union when components use Extract<> for type narrowing.

## P2 Shell Polish Sprint (5:06–5:35 PM MST)

Continued UX work on `apps/web-next` while original sprint deadline (7:30 AM Feb 22) still has 14+ hrs.

**Shipped in this session:**

### App.tsx full overhaul
- Inline Cmd+K command palette: fuzzy search, ↑↓ Enter nav, recent views tracked in localStorage, Alt+1–9 shortcut badges shown
- Alt+1–9 keyboard shortcuts to jump to first 9 nav views
- Alt+← / Alt+→ history back/forward navigation with full stack
- [ / ] to collapse/expand sidebar
- Top header bar: back/forward buttons, breadcrumb (OpenClaw / emoji View), search trigger + ⌘K badge
- Mobile responsive sidebar: hamburger, slide-in overlay with backdrop blur, close button
- Skip-nav link (sr-only, focus-visible for WCAG)
- ViewErrorBoundary class component with try-again recovery
- Key-based view transitions via `animate-slide-in` CSS
- ARIA throughout: nav role, aria-label, aria-current="page", aria-modal on palette dialog

### New components
- `src/components/KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx` — press `?` to open, shows all shortcuts with kbd styling, groups, Escape to close
- `src/components/Toast.tsx` — ToastProvider + useToast hook, 4 variants, auto-dismiss, slide-in animation (built by quinn agent)
- `src/components/Skeleton.tsx` — 6 skeleton variants mapped per-view: DashboardSkeleton, TableSkeleton, CardGridSkeleton, ChatSkeleton, ContentSkeleton, Skeleton base
- `src/components/CommandPalette.tsx` — standalone component built by piper agent (compiled but currently inline impl used in App.tsx)

**Final build:** ✓ 1.36s, 0 TypeScript errors

**Delegation note:** piper agent was spawned mid-work for CommandPalette — built a good standalone component but I'd already integrated inline. Both exist; inline is used. quinn agent did Toast system cleanly.

**Lessons:**
- When spawning agents for components that touch App.tsx, expect conflicts — do the App.tsx wiring yourself
- `key={activeView}` + CSS animation = instant view transitions with zero library overhead
- Skeleton map pattern (viewId → skeleton component) is clean and maintainable

## Evening Sprint — Adaptive UX (8:04–8:10 PM MST)

**Context:** Main sprint goal (10-12 views by 7:30 AM Feb 22) already massively exceeded — 16 views + full P2 shell polish. No active subagents. Picked up remaining P2 work.

### Shipped: Adaptive Proficiency System

**Commit `a9f1a3f`** on `apps/web-next`:

1. **`src/stores/proficiencyStore.tsx`** — Adaptive UX store (React Context + localStorage, no new deps)
   - 4 levels: `beginner` → `intermediate` → `advanced` → `expert`
   - Auto-promotion: interaction thresholds at 20 / 60 / 150
   - `visitView(id)` counts 2 interactions; `recordInteraction()` counts 1
   - `manuallySet` flag: user-chosen level locks out auto-promotion
   - Exported: `useProficiency()`, `useProficiencyLevel()`, `ProficiencyProvider`

2. **`src/components/ComplexityGate.tsx`** — Gating component
   - `<ComplexityGate minLevel="advanced">` renders children only at min level
   - `teaser` prop shows subtle unlock hint when level not met
   - `fallback` prop for alternate content
   - Convenience: `IntermediateFeature`, `AdvancedFeature`, `ExpertFeature`

3. **`src/components/ProficiencyBadge.tsx`** — Sidebar footer widget
   - Compact badge showing level emoji + name + auto/manual + action count
   - Click opens popover: select any level manually; progress bars toward next threshold
   - Reset button for clearing progression

4. **App.tsx integration**
   - `ProficiencyProvider` wraps app (above ToastProvider)
   - `useProficiency()` destructured in `AppContent`
   - `navigate()` calls `visitView()` + `recordInteraction()` on every nav
   - `ProficiencyBadge` rendered in sidebar footer when not collapsed

**Build:** ✓ 1.46s, 0 TypeScript errors

**Design notes:**
- Chose React Context over Zustand to avoid adding a dependency — project is intentionally lean
- `manuallySet` flag is critical UX: users hate it when the system ignores their explicit choice
- Progress bars toward next threshold in the popover give users a sense of journey without being gamification-forward
- The gate is about discoverability, not capability gatekeeping — ComplexityGate doesn't lock features, it declutters them

## Evening (9:03 PM MST)

- Discovered PR #44 (`luis/ui-redesign` → `dgarson/fork`) was already open — created by a prior session
- Updated WORKBOARD.md: HRZ2-PR status → `in-review`, table updated (11 done / 1 in-progress)
- Notified Tim (engineering review) and Xavier (product review) via sessions_send
- PR #44 is MERGEABLE, no reviews yet — sitting ready for morning

## Late Evening Sprint (10:08–10:18 PM MST) — Heartbeat

No active subagents. Queue near-empty. Executed A11y audit + creative invention.

### A11y Fixes (WCAG 2.1 AA) — `apps/web-next`

Three targeted fixes caught by grepping for unlabeled inputs and clickable non-button elements:

1. **AgentBuilderWizard.tsx** — Added `htmlFor`/`id` to Agent Name and Role & Responsibilities fields
2. **CronScheduleBuilder.tsx** — Added `htmlFor`/`id` to Job Name; added `sr-only` label + `aria-label` to custom cron expression input
3. **SessionExplorer.tsx** — Converted `<span onClick>` to `<button type="button">` with proper `aria-label` and `focus-visible:ring-2` styling

Zero `focus-visible:` classes was flagged but not critical — all inputs already use `focus:ring-2 focus:outline-none` which behaves identically in Tailwind CSS (same effect). Not worth the churn.

### Creative Invention: AgentPulseMonitor (View #17)

**Commit `f1d6125`** — self-initiated Mode A execution

New view at nav id `"pulse"` — mission control style active agent viewer:
- 3-column layout: agent cards (left) → activity feed (center) → detail panel (right)
- Agent cards: sparkline via inline SVG `<polyline>`, status pulse dot, current task, token count, uptime
- Activity feed: `role="log"`, `aria-live="polite"` — proper a11y for screen readers on live regions
- Live simulation: random event injected every 3.2s — feels real without needing actual data
- Detail panel: 2×2 stats grid, 20-tick bar chart, relationship map (reports to / manages), model label
- Status filter chips double as counters + toggle filters
- All interactive elements: `<button type="button">` with `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-violet-500`
- Clean build: ✓ 0 TS errors, 1.45s, 17.96 kB gzip 5.52 kB

**Design insight:** aria-live=polite on the activity feed is the right choice over aria-atomic — individual events should be announced as they arrive, not the whole feed re-read. This is mission-critical for blind operators monitoring agent health.

**Horizon UI final count: 17 views** (goal was 10-12 by 7:30 AM Feb 22 — deadline still 9.5 hours away)

## Late Night (11:06–11:15 PM MST) — Hourly Heartbeat

No active subagents. Queue complete (17 views all ✅). Goal was 10-12 — we're at 17+. One remaining P2 (Gateway RPC) is blocked on backend contract.

### Creative Invention: NotificationCenter (View #18) — commit `f97de28`

**Mode A** — high confidence, executed immediately.

Master/detail notification hub filling a gap in every agent platform product:

- **Left pane:** Severity filter chips (All/Critical/Warning/Success/Info) + Read state filter + Category dropdown (agent/system/cron/model/session/file) + Cmd+F search
- **Stats bar:** Per-severity live counts above the list
- **Notification cards:** Unread dot, severity badge, category, agent name/emoji, relative time, body preview, meta identifier, pinned indicator
- **Right detail panel:** Full body, agent info card, meta block, event timeline (fired/relative/category/read), primary action CTA button, secondary mark-read/pin/dismiss buttons
- **Live simulation:** New notification injected every 45s (aria-live polite for screen readers)
- **Sort:** Pinned items first, then timestamp descending
- **A11y:** aria-selected (listbox), aria-pressed (filter chips), aria-label on all interactive elements, focus-visible rings on every button/input

**18 total views in Horizon UI.** Goal: 10-12. Build clean: ✓ 0 TS errors, 1.58s.

**Design note:** Pinning is the key power-user feature here — lets operators keep critical alerts visible even after reading. The severity badge is shown in the list (not just the detail) so users can triage at a glance without opening each one. Live simulation via setInterval stays off the network entirely — no unnecessary dependencies.
