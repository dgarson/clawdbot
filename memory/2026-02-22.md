# Luis Memory — 2026-02-22

## 0:10 AM — David's Shipping Amendment

**Directive:** 10-20 UI features FULLY SHIPPED (merged) by 6am. Not planned. Not "in progress." Done.

**Action taken:**
- Created `feat/horizon-ui` branch in dgarson/clawdbot
- Pushed 19-view Horizon UI from local workspace into clawdbot
- Opened PR #61 (feat/horizon-ui → dgarson/fork)

---

## Sprint Explosion Overnight (~12:10 AM – ~2:00 AM)

Squad kept running. Local workspace grew from 19 → 260 views.
Workers: Piper (TeamManagement, AgentComparison, ThemeEditor, SkillBuilder, EmptyState, schema-form system), Quinn (BillingSubscription, ConversationHistory, AgentRelationshipTopology, enhanced CommandPalette), Reed (DeveloperConsole, ChangelogView, PermissionsManager), Wes (DataExportManager, WebhookManager, CrashReporter, SecurityAuditTrail, AgentTopologyView attempt).

---

## 7:13 AM Heartbeat

- Verified 260 views in local workspace, clean build (3.89s, 0 TS errors)
- rsync'd to clawdbot feat/horizon-ui, pushed to GitHub
- Updated PR #61 body to reflect 260-view state
- Posted 6am scorecard to #cb-inbox
- Pinged Tim + Xavier (both on own cycles, queued)

## 7:41 AM Heartbeat

**Inbox:** Empty. **Subagents:** None active.

**Worker PR triage (PRs #63-67 targeting feat/horizon-ui):**
- Extracted net-new files from each: AgentTopologyView (wes), SkillBuilder (piper), EmptyState (piper), schema-form system (piper)
- Quinn (#63): only modifications to existing files (CommandPalette interface refactor using Zustand) — skipped, would break existing App.tsx
- All 5 worker PRs closed with integration comment

**Build issues caught and fixed:**
1. `AgentTopologyView.tsx` imported `d3-force` — not in package.json. Removed. Already covered by `AgentRelationshipTopology.tsx`
2. `OnboardingTour.tsx`, `tourStore.ts`, `commandRegistry.ts` imported Zustand — not in package.json, not imported anywhere. Removed as orphans.
3. App.tsx referenced 3 missing views: `ChangeManagementBoard`, `MultiRegionFailoverManager`, `CostAllocationDashboard` — built all 3 fresh, clean

**Final state:**
- Build: ✓ 1854 modules, 4.27s, 0 TS errors
- PR #61: MERGEABLE, ~173k additions, waiting on Tim or Xavier
- Worker PRs #63-67: CLOSED (content integrated or declined)
- PR #44: CONFLICTING, still open

**Design lesson:** Worker branches built against the 19-view baseline conflicted badly with my 260-view App.tsx. Next sprint: don't push a massive batch commit to the megabranch while workers are in-flight. Either coordinate timing or use feature flags so App.tsx isn't a conflict hotspot.
