**Status:** No active subagents. No mail. Queue: 18/18 views ✅, all P2 shell polish ✅.

**Remaining blocked:** Gateway RPC integration (P2, backend contract pending).

### Creative Invention: ApiKeysManager (View #19) — commit `e738631` (12:10 AM)

**Mode A** — high confidence, executed immediately. Gap was obvious: every developer platform
needs API key management and webhook configuration, and Horizon had none.

**What was built:**
- Tabbed view: API Keys | Webhooks
- API Keys: master/detail, status filter chips (active/revoked/expired), search,
  masked key display (prefix + dots), revoke/rotate/delete, 28-bar sparkline, scope badges
- Webhooks: delivery stats, signing secret (masked but copyable), pause/resume, event tags, failing alert
- Create Key modal: 2-step flow — configure (name/expiry/scopes) → reveal (one-time, copy-before-close)
- Create Webhook modal: name + URL + event multi-select
- Security UX: admin scope warning, "copy now or lose it" banner on key reveal
- Full a11y: role=listbox, role=option, aria-selected, aria-pressed, aria-modal, focus-visible rings

**Build:** ✓ 0 TS errors, 1.47s, 30.88 kB / gzip 6.98 kB

**Total Horizon UI views: 19** (goal was 10-12 by 7:30 AM, ~7.5 hours remain)

## Design Notes

**Key insight from ApiKeysManager:** The one-time reveal pattern (generate → show full key once → dismiss)
is the industry-standard UX (GitHub, Stripe, Vercel all do this). It forces intentional copy-before-close
behaviour and means we never need to store or display the raw secret again. The UI needs to make the urgency
clear without causing anxiety — amber warning + bold "Copy this key now" heading achieves that balance.

**Scope grouping:** Grouping scopes by domain (Agents/Sessions/Models/etc.) is much more scannable than
an alphabetical flat list. Users should be able to reason "I want this service to read agent configs" → check
agents:read — not hunt through a flat list.

**Next inventory:** With 19 views done and 7+ hours remaining, potential next views:
- TeamManagement (user roster, roles, invites)
- AuditLog (raw event log, compliance-focused, CSV export)
- BillingSubscription (plan, usage overage, invoices)

Any of these would fill real product gaps. Will assess at next heartbeat.
