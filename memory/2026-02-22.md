# Luis Memory — 2026-02-22

## 12:04 AM Heartbeat — Midnight Check

**Status:** No active subagents. No mail. Queue: 18/18 views ✅, all P2 shell polish ✅.

**Remaining blocked:** Gateway RPC integration (P2, backend contract pending).

### Creative Invention: ApiKeysManager (View #19) — commit `e738631` (12:10 AM)

**Mode A** — high confidence, executed immediately. Gap was obvious: every developer platform
needs API key management and webhook configuration, and Horizon had none.

**Build:** ✓ 0 TS errors, 1.47s, 30.88 kB / gzip 6.98 kB

## Design Notes (Session 2)

**On parallel agent spawning:** Spawning Quinn/Piper/Wes/Reed simultaneously while I build
is highly effective. Workers complete in 1-5 minutes on simpler view tasks. The key is writing
precise, actionable task specs — workers can't ask questions, so specs need to be complete.

**On VoiceInterface:** The mic button state machine is the heart of the UX — each state needs
a distinct visual signal (color, icon, animation). Pulse rings need CSS keyframes. The transcript
panel doubles as conversation history, making the view genuinely useful for reviewing calls.

**On AgentInsights vs UsageDashboard:** UsageDashboard is org-wide (cost, model totals, billing).
AgentInsights is per-agent (productivity, performance, collaboration patterns). Very distinct.
The 7-day bar charts are the most informative element — they show rhythm, not just totals.

**Total sprint output:** 30 views in ~10.5 hours (4:05 PM → 2:30 AM)
- Original goal: 10-12 views by 7:30 AM
- Actual: 30 views by 2:30 AM (5 hours early, 2.5x the goal)
- All builds clean: 0 TypeScript errors throughout

**Next views (if continuing until 7:30 AM):**
- SecurityDashboard (anomaly detection, IP blocking, auth analysis)
- ChangelogView (product changelog with release notes)
- KnowledgeBase (agent memory/docs management)
- CrashReporter (error reporting from agent runtime)
- AgentConversationTimeline (visual timeline of an agent's sessions)
