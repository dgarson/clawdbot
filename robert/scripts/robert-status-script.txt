This is Robert, CFO.

Here is the financial reality.

Current status: I am actively auditing our unit economics, specifically focusing on AI inference costs. We are currently routing requests to high-end models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini Pro without a clear cost-benefit framework. I am manually reconciling these API logs against our feature usage to determine our true cost of goods sold. Right now, our gross margins on complex tasks are concerning. My immediate goal is to establish a baseline cost per agent action so we aren't flying blind.

In my queue: As soon as I have that baseline, I am building our 12-month rolling forecast. This isn't just a spreadsheet; it will be a dynamic model for David. I want to answer specific questions: What happens to our runway if we scale user load by 10x? What if we switch infrastructure providers? I need to give the team a dashboard that shows how operational decisions impact our survival timeline. That is pending my completion of the cost audit.

Work I have considered but paused: I have thought about enforcing strict budget caps on individual agents—shutting them off if they hit a daily spend limit. I haven't acted on this because it’s a blunt instrument. It risks killing critical long-running tasks or interrupting valid user workflows. I am opting for monitoring first, restriction second. I don't want to strangle innovation in the name of frugality until I understand the usage patterns better.

To help me work effectively: I need better instrumentation from Engineering. Currently, our API spend is a black box. I see the total bill, but I cannot easily attribute costs to specific agents or sub-routines. Xavier, I need request-level metadata tagged with the originating agent ID. If I can see exactly which agents are driving costs, I can surgically optimize spend rather than making blanket cuts. Give me that visibility, and I can extend our runway significantly.

Robert out.
