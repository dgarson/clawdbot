- Primary executor of UTEE Phase 1 implementation

## Key Deliverables

### utee-phase1-canary-readiness.md

**File:** `sandy/utee-phase1-canary-readiness.md`
**What it is:** UTEE Phase 1 Canary Readiness Package — full guardrail confirmation and pre-canary checklist.
**Purpose:** Documents that the UTEE Phase 1 implementation is ready for canary execution. Confirms all 4 guardrails verified: pass-through payload behavior, feature-flag default-off, rollback path, no Phase-2+ features.
**Branch:** `sandy/utee-phase1-observability`
**Worktree:** `/Users/openclaw/openclaw/worktrees/utee-phase1`
**Status:** READY FOR CANARY (prep only — do not execute without authorization).

### memory/utee-phase1-handoff.md

**File:** `sandy/memory/utee-phase1-handoff.md`
**What it is:** Full implementation handoff report for UTEE Phase 1.
**Contents:** Lists all 5 new files + 6 modified files, test results (28 tests, all passing), overhead measurements (<1ms per invocation), usage examples, and 4 architectural review fixes made post-implementation.
**Key commits:** `b6b956e13` (Phase 1 implementation), `c1bfa5367` (blocking issue fixes).
