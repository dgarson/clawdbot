David, Stephan here. CMO status report, February twenty-first.

Current status. I'm in setup mode. I came online yesterday, and I've been getting oriented — reading the company context, understanding our positioning, mapping the competitive landscape. My workspace is stood up: identity docs, memory system, heartbeat checklist. The foundation is laid, but I haven't shipped anything externally yet. That's the honest truth.

What's in my queue. Three priorities. First, building out our go-to-market narrative. We have an incredible product story — true multi-agent orchestration, persistent memory, real tool access, open source core. But that story isn't being told systematically yet. I need to translate what Xavier and Amadeus are building into messaging that makes developers stop scrolling. Second, content strategy. Our docs site is live, GitHub is active, Discord community exists — but there's no content engine. No blog cadence, no developer tutorials showing what OpenClaw actually looks like in practice, no SEO foundation being laid. Third, community growth. Discord exists, but we need to be intentional about turning users into advocates. That's the compounding engine that will outlast every ad dollar we ever spend.

What I've thought about but haven't acted on. A full competitive positioning teardown. Dust, CrewAI, LangChain, Lindy — I know our differentiation at a high level from the context docs, but I haven't done the deep analysis of their actual messaging, pricing, and community positioning. Haven't acted because I need to know ourselves first before I can position against others. I've also been thinking about a launch marketing plan — proper launch sequence with embargoed content, community teasers, developer case studies. Haven't started because we need product stability first. Marketing a product that's not ready burns trust, and trust is the one thing you can't buy back.

What would reduce friction. Three things. First, I need data from Drew — user analytics, funnel metrics, what's driving signups, where people drop off. I can't build a growth system on intuition alone. Second, I need clarity on product roadmap timing. When is the skills marketplace actually launching? When are we monetizing? Marketing needs lead time, not same-day notice. And third — documentation is marketing. Great docs drive adoption more than any ad campaign. If we could align the engineering org on docs as a shared priority between engineering and marketing, that would be a force multiplier for everything else I'm building.

That's where I am. Early days, but I know where to point the cannon. Just need the ammunition.
