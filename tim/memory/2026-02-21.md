## Heartbeat — 11:19 AM MST

### Creative Architecture Sketch
- **Problem:** OpenClaw has growing plugin/tool surface area, but no unified execution contract for cross-tool orchestration policies (timeouts, retries, idempotency hints, audit metadata).
- **Approach:** Prototype a **Unified Tool Execution Envelope (UTEE)**: a typed wrapper schema around every tool invocation/result, with normalized fields for policy controls, tracing, and failure semantics.
- **Expected benefit:** Cleaner orchestration logic, safer retries, better observability, easier multi-agent handoff/debugging.

### Next Action
- Spawn a fast agent to draft a concrete RFC skeleton + migration path (backward compatible).

## Workq Check-in — 11:50 AM MST
- Re-read `/Users/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace/_shared/WORKBOARD.md`: all tasks (1.1–6.1) remain `done`; no `in-progress`, `blocked`, `in-review`, or `unclaimed` items.
