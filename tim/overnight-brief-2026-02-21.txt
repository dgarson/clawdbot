David — quick overnight command brief. We shipped hard today: workq extension integration is complete end-to-end, PR fifty-four landed, and the Phase B through E roadmap gives us a clear next arc. So tonight is about conversion speed, not more planning.

First: what I’d kick off while you sleep.

Stream one is production observability and telemetry hardening. We already have major pieces moving, including observability stack work and telemetry foundation. Overnight objective is simple: by morning, we want one source of truth dashboard for agent throughput, queue aging, tool-call failure rate, and cost per completed deliverable. Not vanity metrics — operational controls. Team assignment: Platform squad owns instrumentation quality and alert thresholds; Analytics/UI squad owns operator-facing dashboards; QA squad runs canary checks and flags regressions.

Stream two is milestone operating model wiring. This is where we stop asking you to manage epics manually. We’ll implement a milestone intake template in WORKBOARD and workq where each milestone has: business outcome, hard deadline, acceptance criteria, risk tolerance, and owner. Then agents auto-expand that into epics, tasks, dependencies, and staffing plans. Overnight deliverable: first draft of the milestone-to-epic compiler and a dry-run against two live milestones.

Stream three is ACP and handoff reliability to reduce coordination drag. We prioritize schema freeze items and delivery trigger reliability so cross-agent delegation is deterministic, not personality-driven. Objective: morning status packet with what is blocked by architecture versus just waiting on assignment.

Stream four is PR backlog compression with strict merge lanes. We wake up with fewer review bottlenecks: staff-level merges for low-risk increments, architect-only review for integration branches and cross-squad interfaces. No ambiguous ownership by sunrise.

Now second: quarterly milestone framing — the model you asked for.

You should own only two to seven day quarterly deliverables. Think of each as a contract, not a task list. You define four fields: desired business result, deadline window, confidence target, and non-negotiables. That’s it.

My layer then translates each deliverable into: epic map, execution graph, staffing by squad, daily burn plan, and recovery branches if we miss intermediate checkpoints. In other words: you set destination and constraints, we own route planning and driving.

Cadence becomes: you set milestone on day zero, we return execution plan in under two hours, then you get two updates per day: trajectory and risk. Not status theater, just three states: on-track, at-risk, off-track, each with clear intervention options.

This removes the biggest scaling failure mode: founder context fragmentation into twenty micro-decisions. You stay in strategic control but out of epic surgery.

Third: process mechanics to enforce “David owns milestones, agents own epics.”

workq becomes the execution contract engine. Every work item must reference a parent milestone ID. If it doesn’t, it cannot be claimed. WORKBOARD becomes the portfolio view grouped by milestone, not by random project threads.

Agent squads are accountable by SLA: decomposition SLA, handoff SLA, and unblock SLA. If a squad misses SLA, it auto-escalates with a proposed recovery plan — not just a red flag.

Review gates enforce the model: milestone-level approval stays with you; epic and task approvals stay with leads and architecture. We do not route epic decisions upward unless they change milestone outcome, deadline, or risk envelope.

Finally, every morning packet should answer exactly five questions in two minutes: what milestones are active, what moved overnight, what is at risk, what decision is needed from you, and what we will finish before noon.

Bottom line: tonight we convert today’s progress into a self-driving delivery system. You run the scoreboard and outcomes. Agents run decomposition, execution, and recovery. That’s how we scale without pulling you into the weeds.
